# 42 C++ Modules

This repository contains my solutions and learnings from the C++ modules at 42 Abu Dhabi. Each folder corresponds to a module, and within each module, you'll find the exercises I worked on along with my explanations and insights.

## Table of Contents

- [Module 00 - Namespaces, Classes, Member Functions, and Basic Concepts](./module00)
  
*More modules will be added as I progress.*

## Repository Structure

Each module is divided into the following:

- **Exercises:** Completed exercises with solutions.
- **Learnings:** Key takeaways, concepts, and explanations of what I learned in the module, often accompanied by Jupyter notebooks to provide a more interactive approach to learning.

## How to Navigate

1. Browse the respective module folder.
2. Review the exercises and solutions.
3. Dive into the "Learnings" section for a summary of the key concepts, which includes Jupyter notebooks for deeper exploration and interactive learning.
