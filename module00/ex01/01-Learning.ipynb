    "\n",
    "#### Class Declaration & Definition\n",
    "A class in C++ is like a struct in C, but with encapsulation. It can contain both data and functions (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class ClassName {\n",
    "    public:\n",
    "    // Data members (variables)\n",
    "    int data;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Member functions (methods)\n",
    "    void show() {\n",
    "        std::cout << \"Data: \" << data << std::endl;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "This declares a class but does not create an object yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is object and what is encapsulation you ask?** \n",
    "#### Object -\n",
    "A class defines the structure (data members) and behavior (member functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where as an object is a concrete instance of the class, created with actual values and the ability to invoke the functions defined in the class.\n",

    "#### Encapsulation -\n",
    "It’s all about bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does it do**\n",
    "1. Hiding the internal state of an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * By making data members private and allowing access to them through public methods, you control how data is accessed and modified.\n",
    "2. Providing a clear interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * You expose a set of functions (public methods) that allow interaction with the object, without exposing its internal workings or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Does Encapsulation Work in C++?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, encapsulation is achieved using access specifiers (like public, private, and protected):\n",
    "* **Private** members are not accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Public** members are accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Protected** members can be accessed by derived classes but not outside the class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE :** We'll be learning about them more later in the modules."
